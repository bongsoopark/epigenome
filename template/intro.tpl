<h3>ECEP History (v0.0.1)</h3>
Epigenome is a broad definition about entire biological ecosystem. Cellular system is interacting with the environmental system, and the cellular signals are triggered by environmental change (such as temporature, UV treatment, pH, and etc). In eukaryotic genome, it is more complicated due to the chromatin structure. Histone, Chromatin remodelers, and Transcription factors are highly co-regulated to do a certain biological function. The ECEP (i-sep) will facilitate the easy-to-use bioinformatics analysis using any NGS reads (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and MNase-seq). Moreover, it will provide the comparative genomics tools to understand the human genomes based on the observation from model organisms. Yeast, Fly, Mouse are good examples.
