<h2>Eukaryotic Comparative Epigenomics Platform</h2>
<br>
<h3>ECEP History (v0.0.3)</h3>
Motivation:<br>
Epigenome is a broad definition about entire biological ecosystem. Cellular system is interacting with the environmental system, and the cellular signals are triggered by environmental change (such as temporature, UV treatment, pH, and etc). In eukaryotic genome, it is more complicated due to the chromatin structure. Histone, Chromatin remodelers, and Transcription factors are highly co-regulated to do a certain biological function. The ECEP (i-sep) will facilitate the easy-to-use bioinformatics analysis using any NGS reads (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and MNase-seq). Moreover, it will provide the comparative genomics tools to understand the human genomes based on the observation from model organisms. Yeast, Fly, Mouse are good examples.

Not only we are interested in the human model organisms, but we are also interested in the plant associated organisms. The entired eukaryotic species is topic of interest. Plant model organism including arabidopsis, rice, and the associated micro-organisms such as pathogens are a part of this database. Plant and phytobiome can be more easily expained by interaction between host-pathogen mechanisms. Environmental factor is very important part of this interaction. Human microbiome is another big topic in the field of biology. All living organisms are related each other. So, we will include some of micro organisms as well this database. (bacteria, archea, and virus).<br><br>

This platform was inspred by Yeast, Mouse and Human ENCODE project. We will cover many publicaly available NGS datasets for meta analysis. Users can upload their own experimental datasets for further in-depth analysis too. We provide the platform, you will analyze what you want. It's win-win! The background analysis will be conducted by Galaxy framework, and result will be displayed via PHP (or Django,Groovy) framework. The initial version don't have any fancy graphical interface. It's a long term project. Please see how it evolve in the future.<br><br>
