<h3>Guide Page (v0.1.1)</h3>
<b>Main page:</b><br>
Main page will give you a gateway to navigate many contents in ECEP. It provides the general statistics for the database. You can see four sections. 1) Database Statistics 2) Regulome Proteins 3) Genomics Education 4) User Statistics. In each section, there are useful contents you can use it. Also, you will see two top buttons. Help page, just you clicked it, and Cart page, it is a project starting point with your dataset. You can collect the genes, so you can do any comparative genomics studies, or you can start from the samples, so you can do any epigenome analysis. Finally, we will provide the mixed approach of comparative epigenomics using this Favorite cart function. In below, you will see the tweet update. EpigenomeDB will be advertised by using tweets.

<b>Database Statistics and Browsing</b><br>
In the datawarehouse we archived Species, Genome, Dataset, and Study information. All datasets are derived from the published NIH NCBI repository, so all contents will have unique IDs associated with NCBI. For example, when you navigate the Publications, it has the PMID, so it can be directly linked to PubMED. In case of species, it has a uniq Taxon ID, so all dataset is from NCBI. This platform is highly depenent to NCBI contents, because NCBI is one of the largest data repository for life science.<br><br>
<b>Regulome Proteins</b><br>
Regulome proteins are the repository of curated protein families. It is very important resource to do any comparative genomics. If you want to model the human cell using yeast genome, then it can be very useful. We are focused on the regulatory proteins such as chromatin remodelers, transcription factors, and histone modifying enzymes. Those are very important to understand the genome and epignome mechanisms of the cells. We also collect any general regulome proteins known to be discovered by literature.<br><Br>
<b>Genomics Education</b><br>
One of the key feature of this platform is to provide the easy-to-use reproducible bioinformatics framework. Based on the Galaxy workflow system, we designe web interface to interact with Galaxy. We will start from the simple analysis, then make it available for the public via Galaxy framework. Also, strategic methods are any published figures how you can make the same or very similiar figure so you can use the figures in your publications. If you want to reproduce any figures in any publications, please contanct us, so we can work together. Finally, Q/A session will provide the forum to enhance this platform
<br><br>
<b>User statistics</b><br>
This resource is not free. The maintenance of the server is time consuming, and required the resource. The system will be gradulally increased based on the user statistics. How many users think it is useful, and it will recorde your analysis patterns. Because it is open-source platform, your analysis will be opened as well. if you have any unpublished datasets, please request the personal storage. We may need to provide the consult for you. As long as you reproduce the same workflow we have, it is free for you. If you have a large dataset, then let us know. We will allow you to use the storage. 
<br><br>
<b>Tweets epigenome db</b><br>
Communication is very important to enhance this platform and improve it. It is also very imporant to share the success stories. We are very happy to help you for your publications. Epigenome analysis is very early stage, so many tools and methods will be introduced. This platform is dedicated to epigenome analysis, and comprative genomics (sometime you don't have enough information to the your organisms). Please tweet via our tweet account or re-tweet, so we can communicate effencintley.

This platform was inspred by Yeast, Mouse and Human ENCODE projects. We will cover many publicaly available NGS datasets for their meta analysis. Guest users are allowed to upload their own experimental datasets for the further in-depth analysis. We provide the platform, and you analyze what you want. Sometimes, the analysis pileline is quite similiar with others, then you can share your workflow with others. It's a win-win! The background analyses will be conducted by Galaxy framework; which is a widely used bioinformatics workflow platform. (Galaxy's home is here at Penn State!). Finally, the analysis result will be displayed via PHP (or Django,Groovy) frameworks. (Galaxy-API to the frameworks with RESTful API). The initial version don't have any fancy graphical interface. It's a long term project. Please see how it evolve in the future.<br><br>
